    <h2>Project Goals</h2>
    <p>
      We plan to investigate the level of correlation between public protest and actions of government particularly from the 1960s on. In terms of government action, we will be examining one or more of the following actions: amendments to the Constitution and/or bills proposed by Congress, judicial decisions of the Supreme Court, or executive orders of the President. For public protests we will be examining the purpose of the protest, the amount of people involved, and the impact it had. By time period, location, and topic we plan to characterize the relationship between these variables. Building a visual medium for this relationship will allow for useful insight into the workings of these factors.

We envision a broad set of users including historians, politicians, news organizations, NGOs or activist organizations, and the general public. Historians could use these visualizations to track movements in history. Politicians could consider them to determine how the will of the people has been received or acted upon in the past, and if that worked well or not for the politicians of the time. News organizations could use these to determine trends in protest and government action in the past and compare them to current events in contemporary reporting. NGOs or activist organizations could use these to inspire action in the form of public protest (depending on what the data reveal). Finally, the general public could look at these visualizations to better understand their power in our civic system. 

We would like our visualizations to have enough flexibility that they could be used as an exploratory analysis tool, especially by those like historians who many have more context and knowledge of a time period to explore. However, for a given filtering or focused view of the information, we would like to be able to convey a narrative of change over time or of public involvement during a particular period of history.

    <h2>Data</h2>
    <p>
      Core Datasets:
Protest Data from 1960-1995: This dataset contains information about each protest's date, number of people involved, the topic of the protest, the violence level of of the protest, etc. This will be used primarily to measure how government action influences protests and how public protest influences government action.

Proposed Amendments from 1787 to 2014: This dataset notably includes the names of the amendments and sponsoring states and congressmen and women. We can use this to track which topics were prevalent at different times, and if certain issues were more important to certain states in any given year.

US Supreme Court Rulings from 1946 to 2015: This dataset includes information about the topic of the court case, the decision, the head justice, and more. We will use this data to measure how topic and decision of the supreme court influenced or was influenced by public protest.

Executive Orders: These datasets include titles of executive orders, the president who issued them, and the date, as well as other notes regarding their amendment or revocation.
Since 1994 in CSV form: https://www.federalregister.gov/executive-orders
Since the 1930s in HTML: https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/executive-orders/disposition

Congressional Bills from 1947 to 2015:
This dataset includes information about over 400,000 public and private bills introduced in the U.S. House and Senate since 1947, including its description, primary topic, progress, and sponsor.

Ratification statistics by states on amendments that went through Congress (in book scans, would need to compile a dataset): http://www.worldcat.org/title/ratification-of-the-constitution-and-amendments-by-the-states-data-on-the-ratification-of-the-constitution-and-amendments-by-the-states-prepared-by-the-legislative-reference-service-of-the-library-of-congress-presented-by-mr-fess-january-5-calendar-day-january-6-1931-ordered-to-be-printed/oclc/858254748
